HeavyM Live is the extended version of HeavyM Beta. At this point we want to thank the HeavyM Team again for providing us with some trial licenses for our workshop. It provides a lot more functionality than the Beta version. Connect your projector. After you downloaded and installed HeavyM Live you get the window below on startup.

### Basic Usage

The application consists of two windows. The editor window and the projection window. To get the projection window up and running you need to connect your window and enable your projector by clicking on the projector icon on the top of the window. You will be presented with a screen selection. Select the one that is your secondary screen and hit okay. Your secondary screen should now be a black fullscreen window.

#### Adding Faces  

Now you can now start dragging and droping faces onte the editor window. There are the possibility to add:  

- Triangles
- Rectangles
- Ellipses
- Polygons (free forms)  
- Media overlays (we will look into that in the section [Loading Media](#loading-media))

For easier handling there is button for activating magnetic corners on the faces. it makes your faces snap together and prevents having unwanted holes. Start building your object. You can delete unwanted faces just by selcting them and hitting âŒ« (delete).
