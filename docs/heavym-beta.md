The HeavyM Beta is, as described in the [Workflow section](workflows/) a smaller version of [HeavyM Live](heavym-live/). For a lot of use cases this might be enough.  
The application consists of two windows. The editor and the projection. When starting the application you should send the projection into the fullscreen mode on your projector window. Adjust the position of your projector and keep track of where the projector and your object are.  
For the moment we wont look into audio input.
